# Project 1: Prediction of Cardiac Disorder

The project's purpose is to create an algorithm that can accurately identify individuals based on their risk of developing heart disease utilizing the available healthcare parameters.



# Project 2: NBA Salary Prediction 

I will be using the NBA player statistics dataset obtained from Kaggle for this project. The statistics are listed on the website as coming from 2017-2018 team rosters, although upon closer inspection, the rosters appear to be from 2016-2017.
There were 88 missing salary values in the downloaded data. Apart from two, all of these were taken via HoopsHype.com.
There are 52 variables in the dataset. Not all of these are significant to projecting player pay, and the technical method section following will provide a full breakdown of the variables employed.


# Project 3: COVID-19 Rates

The procedure was also tied to the fact that this current state of mind continues to effect our lives. We've reached a point where the number of deaths is about the same as it was at the start.

# Project 4: Mental Health Prediction

As recently I have received a form from my employer to complete the survey on Mental health conditions. Because of the Corona Virus situation, everyone is working remotely and restricting themselves not to go out other than to get groceries. Spending most of the time at home, now a days leading to depression and other mental health issue. 
I would like to explore to see what factors are influencing the mental health conditions by relating different factors variables and find which categories of people are more effected.

# Project 5: COVID-19 Rates

The procedure was also tied to the fact that this current state of mind continues to effect our lives. We've reached a point where the number of deaths is about the same as it was at the start.

# Project 6: Analysis of Chopped Injuries' Success

Chopped is a popular Food Network competition cooking show in which four judges compete to create a dish in three rounds after being given a basket of random items to integrate into each dish. A panel of three judges is assigned to each episode and is in charge of choosing which chef will be removed or â€˜Chopped' from the competition.

# Project 7: Customer Banking Behavior Prediction

The project's goal is to look into the success rate of a Portuguese bank's direct campaign marketing in terms of customer retention, which is what this data set is about. It's critical to figure out what factors influence the direct campaign's outcome and which factors are required for a positive result that leads to a subscription.

# Project 8: Detecting Credit Card Fraud

The enclosed data analysis project aims to build a machine learning model that has the capability to predict, with great accuracy, when a credit card transaction presents as being fraudulent. Beginning with exploratory data analysis, I will use machine learning algorithms to understand and work through these data. By exploring the data set and understanding trends, I will build and train multiple models to predict which transactions are fraudulent, ultimately aiming to test and select the most accurate model for this set of data.
Income analysis in relation to many variables
This study looks at income statistics from the United States and how it relates to other factors. Variables in the used data set describe individuals as well as their yearly income level, which is either greater than or less than $50,000. The ability of variables to predict income level is evaluated. The factors are analyzed, and two of them are shown to be very good at predicting income level based on their own levels. More research is needed to see if less accurate variables may accurately predict the same measurement.
